School project about creating a bot to play a game with simple rules created by the teacher.

Rules : 
You have to navigate through a grid.
There are two players that play according to turns.
Each player choose to go either right or downwards from the location of the other player who played the turn before.

Every box on the grid has a number, and that number is added to the player's score when that player choose to move onto it.
The player with the greatest score once the bottom right corner is reached wins.
